A **team-driven automation orchestration system** that lets teams collaboratively design and launch **n8n workflows directly inside Slack**.  
Instead of one developer manually configuring n8n, this bot allows **natural team conversations → instant, execution-ready workflows**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🗣 **Collaboration-first** → Teams brainstorm automation needs naturally in Slack  
- 🎯 **Trigger-based orchestration** → Bot only listens when `@slack-trigger` is invoked  
- ⚡ **Execution-ready workflows** → Generates complete n8n workflows (node-by-node, credentials, and configuration)  
- 🔄 **Dynamic parsing** → Converts multi-user Slack discussions into structured JSON workflows  
- 🔐 **Credential-aware** → Integrates Google Sheets, Slack, Gmail, and other APIs securely

## 🚀 Example Flow

### Slack Conversation → Workflow
👩‍💻 Teammate 1: @slack-trigger Let’s automate a workflow that fetches sales data from Google Sheets every morning and posts it to Slack.
👨‍💻 Teammate 2: How about adding an email step to send it to the manager?
👩‍💻 Teammate 1: Sounds great.
👩‍💻 Teammate 1: @slack-trigger Add an email step to send it to the manager.
🤖 Bot: Got it! Shall I proceed with building this workflow?
👨‍💻 Teammate 2: @slack-trigger Proceed
